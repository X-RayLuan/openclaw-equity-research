## Product Preview

OpenClaw Equity Research is a skillpack that gives OpenClaw a structured analyst workflow instead of a generic stock prompt.

It helps the agent:

- choose the right research workflow for the request
- gather fresh primary sources when facts are current or market-sensitive
- separate facts, calculations, assumptions, inference, and judgment
- produce notes with evidence tables, risks, counterarguments, and review gates
- route spreadsheet, document, presentation, and web-research work to the right tools

The skill is built for research assistance and analyst workflow automation. It is not financial, legal, tax, accounting, or trading advice.

| Idea generation | Dislocations, estimate revisions, quality versus valuation, margin inflection, refinancing risk, short interest, ownership changes |

### Source and Tooling Coverage

| Type | Preferred Sources or Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Primary company evidence | SEC/company filings, investor relations releases, earnings presentations, transcripts, official company websites |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use in OpenClaw Webchat

Install or sync the skill into OpenClaw's active workspace skills path:

```text
/Users/m1/.openclaw/workspace/skills/openclaw-equity-research/
```

Then ask:

```text
Use OpenClaw Equity Research to write an earnings preview for NVDA.
```

```text
Prepare a post-earnings update for TSLA with reported KPIs, guidance changes, model implications, and risks.
```

```text
Build a catalyst calendar for AMD and NVDA for the next two quarters.
```

```text
Draft an initiating coverage outline for RKLB with valuation framework and thesis kill criteria.
```

```text
Compare PLTR and SNOW as an idea-generation screen with evidence, counterarguments, and next diligence.
```

### Option 2: Use the Lightweight Script

From this skill directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/equity_research.py AAPL --out reports
python3 scripts/equity_research.py TSLA NVDA RKLB --mode watchlist --out reports
python3 scripts/equity_research.py --template AAPL --out reports
```

The script writes:

- `{ticker}-equity-research.md`
- `{ticker}-equity-research.json`
- `watchlist-equity-research.md`

The script is intentionally lightweight. It is a fast starting point; the skill instructions tell OpenClaw to add fresh sourcing, assumptions, judgment, and human-review gates when the user needs a research-quality output.

## Research Workflow

### 1. Classify the deliverable

OpenClaw first identifies whether the task is an earnings note, preview, model update, initiation, sector overview, catalyst calendar, thesis tracker, idea screen, or one-off memo.

### 2. Gather current evidence

For current company facts, market prices, estimates, filings, executives, calendar events, and news, OpenClaw should browse or use connected data sources. It should prefer primary sources and disclose stale or missing data.

### 3. Build the research artifact

The default research artifact includes:

- **Snapshot**: company, ticker, date, source freshness, currency, market data timestamp
- **Key takeaways**: what changed, why it matters, what to watch
- **Evidence table**: metric/event, source, reported value, comparison point, implication
- **Model and valuation assumptions**: drivers, ranges, sensitivities, conclusion-changing inputs
- **Risks and counterarguments**: strongest opposing case and missing diligence
- **Source list**: links or local files for material claims
- **Human review note**: checks needed before external use

### 4. Review before external use

The skill explicitly blocks unsupported recommendation language, invented market data, hidden valuation assumptions, mixed currencies or fiscal periods, and external publishing without user approval.
